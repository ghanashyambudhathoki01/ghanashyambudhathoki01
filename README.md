## 📘 My Learning Journey
I began learning Python with the goal of building a future in tech, even though I had no programming background.  
Over time, I’ve completed a Python bootcamp on Udemy and followed tutorials from creators like *Code With Harry*.  
Alongside Python, I’ve explored tools like Git, GitHub, and even system admin platforms during my internship.  
My focus right now is practicing consistently, building small projects, and learning how real-world tools and code work together.
